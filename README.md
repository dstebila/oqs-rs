liboqs-rust: Rust bindings for liboqs
=====================================

[![Build status](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-rs/workflows/Continuous%20integration/badge.svg)](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-rs/actions?query=workflow%3A"Continuous+integration")

**liboqs-rust** offers two Rust wrappers for the [Open Quantum Safe](https://openquantumsafe.org/) [liboqs](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/) C library, which is a C library for quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms.

* The ``oqs-rs`` crate compiles and builds ``liboqs`` and generates ``unsafe`` bindings to the C library.
* The ``oqs`` crate offers a Rust-style safe interface to the schemes included in ``liboqs``.

Pre-requisites
--------------

``oqs-sys`` depends on the [liboqs](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs) C library.
It will build ``liboqs`` automatically.

Contents
--------

This crate provides unsafe `ffi` bindings in the `oqs-sys` crate, and safe wrappers are offered via the `oqs` crate.

Usage
-----

Update your ``Cargo.toml`` and include ``oqs``:

```toml
[dependencies]
oqs = { git = "https://github.com/Open-Quantum-Safe/liboqs-rs" }
```

``oqs-sys`` can be specified equivalently.

Running
-------

```rust
/// # Example: Some signed KEX
/// This protocol has no replay protection!
///
use oqs::*;
fn main() -> Result<()> {
    let sigalg = sig::Sig::new(sig::Algorithm::Dilithium2)?;
    let kemalg = kem::Kem::new(kem::Algorithm::Kyber512)?;
    // A's long-term secrets
    let (a_sig_pk, a_sig_sk) = sigalg.keypair()?;
    // B's long-term secrets
    let (b_sig_pk, b_sig_sk) = sigalg.keypair()?;

    // assumption: A has (a_sig_sk, a_sig_pk, b_sig_pk)
    // assumption: B has (b_sig_sk, b_sig_pk, a_sig_pk)

    // A -> B: kem_pk, signature
    let (kem_pk, kem_sk) = kemalg.keypair()?;
    let signature = sigalg.sign(kem_pk.as_ref(), &a_sig_sk)?;

    // B -> A: kem_ct, signature
    sigalg.verify(kem_pk.as_ref(), &signature, &a_sig_pk)?;
    let (kem_ct, b_kem_ss) = kemalg.encapsulate(&kem_pk)?;
    let signature = sigalg.sign(kem_ct.as_ref(), &b_sig_sk)?;

    // A verifies, decapsulates, now both have kem_ss
    sigalg.verify(kem_ct.as_ref(), &signature, &b_sig_pk)?;
    let a_kem_ss = kemalg.decapsulate(&kem_sk, &kem_ct)?;
    assert_eq!(a_kem_ss, b_kem_ss);

    Ok(())
}
```


Adding new algorithms
---------------------

### KEMs

1. Update the Git submodule
2. `oqs-sys` will now update when you build again
3. Add it to the ``implement_kems!`` macro call in ``oqs/src/kem.rs``:
  - The structure is a name for the algorithm in CamelCase, and the name of the constant of the algorithm (``OQS_KEM_alg_...``)

### Signature schemes:

1. Update the Git submodule
2. `oqs-sys` is now up-to-date when you build again
3. Add it to ``implement_sigs!`` macro call in ``oqs/src/sig.rs``.
  - The structure is a name for the algorithm in CamelCase, and the name of the constant of the algorithm (``OQS_SIG_alg_...``)

Limitations and security
------------------------

liboqs is designed for prototyping and evaluating quantum-resistant cryptography. Security of proposed quantum-resistant algorithms may rapidly change as research advances, and may ultimately be completely insecure against either classical or quantum computers.

We believe that the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography standardization project is currently the best avenue to identifying potentially quantum-resistant algorithms. liboqs does not intend to "pick winners", and we strongly recommend that applications and protocols rely on the outcomes of the NIST standardization project when deploying post-quantum cryptography.

We acknowledge that some parties may want to begin deploying post-quantum cryptography prior to the conclusion of the NIST standardization project. We strongly recommend that any attempts to do make use of so-called **hybrid cryptography**, in which post-quantum public-key algorithms are used alongside traditional public key algorithms (like RSA or elliptic curves) so that the solution is at least no less secure than existing traditional cryptography.
